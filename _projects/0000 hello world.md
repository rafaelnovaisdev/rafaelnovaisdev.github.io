## Hello World üåç 

Welcome to **rafaelnovaisdev.dev**.

## How I Built This üöÄ  

This website was set up using:  

- **GitHub Pages** for hosting
- **Jekyll** with the **no-style-please** theme  
- **Namecheap** & **Cloudflare** for a custom DNS domain  
- **Zoho Mail** for email hosting (<rafa@rafaelnovais.dev>)
- **Cursor IDE** and its AI models for coding, content, UI, and more

## Update #1 (2025-07-14)

- Aligned the project section for better visibility and organization while testing **Windsurf** and its capabilities.
- Analyzing the possibility of a blog content where I synthesize some ideas & link some interesting resources.
