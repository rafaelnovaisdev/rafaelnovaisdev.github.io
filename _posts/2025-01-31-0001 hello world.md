# Hello World! 🌍  

Welcome to **rafaelnovais.dev**.

## How I Built This 🚀  

This website was set up using:  

- **GitHub Pages** for hosting
- **Jekyll** with the **no-style-please** theme  
- **Namecheap** for a custom dns domain  
- **Zoho Mail** for email hosting (<rafa@rafaelnovais.dev>)
- **Cursor IDE** and its AI models for coding, content, UI, and more
