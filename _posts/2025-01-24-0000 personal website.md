## **Introduction**

With all the talk about AI replacing humans, I want to try out current state-of-the-art AI tools like Cursor IDE and ChatGPT, evaluate them, draw my own conclusions ...

**Web development was never my thing, but I always wanted a website, so I decided to build one.** 

Over the next 3–5 days, my plan is to use AI to build a personal website with:
- A useful links and bookmarks section.
- A portfolio.
- A blog.
- And possibly more...

---

## **Checklist**

- [ ] **Have an MVP**:  
  - Set up Jekyll with a basic theme.  
  - Use GitHub Pages for hosting.  
  - Get a DNS name linked to the site.  

- [ ] **Portfolio**:  
  - Create a dedicated section for showcasing my projects.  
  - Add placeholders for future projects.  

- [ ] **Blog**:  
  - Add a blog section with a view counter for posts.  
  - Write an initial post (this one).  

- [ ] **Useful Links and Bookmarks**:  
  - Add a section for curated links and resources.

## **Reflection**

<!-- Once the website is live, I'll evaluate the entire process:
- **AI Tools**: How effective were Cursor IDE and ChatGPT in streamlining development?  
- **Challenges**: What issues did I face, and how did I solve them?  
- **Takeaways**: Lessons learned about web development, hosting, and using AI-powered tools. -->

## **Closing**

<!-- This is a small but important step towards building something tangible and personal. The process itself will help me learn, grow, and refine my skills.  

If you're thinking about starting a project like this, my advice is simple: **just begin.** You'll figure out the rest along the way.

Let's see what the next 3–5 days bring. 🚀 -->


## **Next Ideas**

-It occured me, when writing blog post, to have "ChatGPT" as a tag. and link that to my skills. I could do that for all the tags, Cursor IDE, etc etc web development, etc etc... 
I can even create a script that crawls to my website and identifies  tags that I should have or need to make a page off. 

- also, have same thing but for quotes. So, have quotes associanted to a person and refer to them, like a tag, in each blog post or project.
